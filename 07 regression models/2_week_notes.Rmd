## Statistical linear regression models

How do we do inference?

Consider developing a probabilistic model for linear regression
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_{i}
$$
Here the $\epsilon_{i}$ are assumed iid $N(0, \sigma^2)$. 

Note, $E[Y_i ~|~ X_i = x_i] = \mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$

Note, $Var(Y_i ~|~ X_i = x_i) = \sigma^2$.
