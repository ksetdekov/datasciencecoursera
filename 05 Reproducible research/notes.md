# Reproducible research
## Week 1
### Conceptes and ideas
Replication is the most important in science. Very important for regulatory stuff.
What is wrong with repication?
Stidies are 
- bigger
- opportunistic
- more expensive
- unique
#### Why we need middle ground?
(data + computational infromation). Data + code => somewhat shure that reporducible.
- high data collection speed
- multidimensional
- models, analysis and algorithms are much more comples -> every field "X" has a "Computational"

#### research pipeline
we read from text to data, but the pipeline came from measured data to the article.
to read:
1. Reproducible research in computational science (special issue)
2. 60 minutes "The duke saga"
3. Evolution of translational omics, lessons learned and path forward.

#### what we need?
- analytic data are available (data used for analysis)
- analytic code (code applied to this)
- documentation of code
- standard means of distribution

#### players
- authors
  - want reproducible 
  - need tools
- readers
  - want to reproduce
  - want tools for RR to have simpler life
#### challenges
- resources
- effort
- toolbox for RR are bad and fiew
